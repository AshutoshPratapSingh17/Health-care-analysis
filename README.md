🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis with Python
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insight generation from healthcare datasets using Python. It helps uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in patient and hospital data, which can support decision-making in public health and clinical management.

📁 Project Overview
Title: Healthcare Analysis using Python

Tools & Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

Focus: Understanding healthcare data distribution, patient trends, and potential health risks

Approach: Data cleaning ➤ EDA ➤ Visualization ➤ Interpretation

🔬 Features
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, data type conversion, and normalization.

📊 Statistical Summary & Correlation Analysis
Analyze distributions, relationships between features, and compute summary stats.

🧠 Health Metric Trends
Explore BMI, glucose, blood pressure, and age-related health patterns.

📈 Visual Reports
Use line charts, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps for clear data storytelling.

📌 Optional Prediction Models
(Can be added) Use logistic regression or decision trees for disease prediction.
